Write a commit message using this structure:

```
<type>(scope): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Example types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore, revert
Example scopes: db, backend, frontend, ci, docker
Very rarely, include a body for more details in bullet points with dash (-).
Optionally, in the footer, use BREAKING CHANGE: followed by a detailed explanation of the breaking change.
